# Shitpost Paster
Generates shitposts right to your clipboard generated from 4chan or text files

##Setup
1. First install Python 3.5.2 ([Windows installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-amd64.exe) [Mac Installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-macosx10.6.pkg))
2. Download the shitpost paster from the releases page
3. Run setup.bat to have it install all the required dependencies (only needs to be done once, mac and linux owners will need to do this manually)
4. Run start.bat to start using the shitpost paster

##Usage
Shitpost paster runs in the command line right now, and just follow what it says to start using it. 
You will first need to create a bot and train it from either a 4chan thread or a file, and give that bot a name.
All bots are stored in the data folder which is created when the program is first ran. just type the bots name when you want
to open the bot to use

This allows you to have different bots with different 'personalities', which can be trained to create all kinds of different shitposts
Shitposts are automatically loaded into your clipboard, allowing for easy pasting anywhere, even in the chats of your favorite games

##Dependencies
The setup.bat should handle this automatically, but for those who need to do it manually the dependencies are:
